# Migrating to `swift-sdk`@3.0.0

## Breaking Changes

- [New Authentication Scheme](#new-authentication-scheme)
- [Breaking changes by service](#breaking-changes-by-service)
- [iOS minimum deployment target](#ios-deployment-target)
- [Speech to Text Cloud Foundry Web Socket support](#stt-cloudfoundry-websocket-support)
- [Dropping Swift 4.1 support](#swift-4.1-support)

### New Authentication Scheme

We have implemented a new way to authenticate for all services. We now provide `Authenticator`s that are used to authenticate behind-the-scenes. This requires a minor change to the initialization of a service class.

Below is an example of the difference between the old and new method, using IAM authentication (the default authentication type for most services on the public IBM Cloud) as an example:

OLD VERSION (swift-sdk@2.3.0 and earlier):
```swift
// NOTE: this is the OLD version which no longer works!!!
import NaturalLanguageClassifierV1

let naturalLanguageClassifier = NaturalLanguageClassifier(apiKey: "apikey")
```

NEW VERSION (swift-sdk@3.0.0 and beyond):
```swift
import NaturalLanguageClassifierV1
import RestKit

let authenticator = IAMAuthenticator(apiKey: "apikey")
let naturalLanguageClassifier = NaturalLanguageClassifier(authenticator: authenticator)
```

Additionally, the new authentication format for service instances that are on Cloud Foundry would now look like:

```swift
import NaturalLanguageClassifierV1
import RestKit

let authenticator = BasicAuthenticator(username: "username", password: "password")
let naturalLanguageClassifier = NaturalLanguageClassifier(authenticator: authenticator)
```

#### Watson RestKit as a new dependency

As you most likely noticed in the updated examples, in order to use version `3.0.0` a new dependency `watson-developer-cloud/restkit` needs to be added to your project. Previously, this was a transitive dependency that only the Swift SDK interacted with, but now it is required in projects using the SDK, as it exposes the `Authenticator` classes and sub-classes.

- Interface `DialogRuntimeResponseGeneric` removed

#### Compare Comply
- Parameter `filename` removed from method `convertToHtml`

#### Discovery
- Parameter `return_fields` renamed to `return` in method `query`
- Parameter `logging_opt_out` renamed to `xWatsonLoggingOptOut` in method `query`
- Parameter `return_fields` renamed to `return` in method `federatedQuery`
- Parameter `logging_opt_out` renamed to `xWatsonLoggingOptOut` in method `federatedQuery`
- Parameter `return_fields` renamed to `return` in method `queryNotices`
- Parameter `return_fields` renamed to `return` in method `federatedQueryNotices`
- Property `field_name` renamed to `field` in interface `Field`
- Property `field_type` renamed to `type` in interface `Field`

#### Language Translator
- Parameter `default_models` renamed to `default` in method `listModels`
- Property `translation_output` renamed to `translation` in interface `Translation`

#### Natural Language Classifier
- Parameter `metadata` renamed to `trainingMetadata` in method `createClassifier`

#### Speech to Text
- Parameter `finalResult` has been renamed to `final` in method `recognize`

#### Text to Speech
- The following voices are removed:
  - `DE_DE_BIRGITV2VOICE`
  - `DE_DE_DIETERV2VOICE`
  - `EN_US_ALLISONV2VOICE`
  - `EN_US_LISAV2VOICE`
  - `EN_US_MICHAELV2VOICE`
  - `IT_IT_FRANCESCAV2VOICE`

#### Visual Recognition
- Property `class_name` renamed to `class` in interface `ClassResult`

### iOS Deployment Target

The minimum iOS Deployment target has been raised to `iOS 10.0`

### STT CloudFoundry Websocket support

Websocket support for Speech to Text Cloud Foundry instances has been dropped. Please migrate your service instance to a Resource Controller instance which uses IAM authentication.

### Swift 4.1 support

We no longer support Swift 4.1. The SDK may continue to work on this version, as Swift does maintain strong source compatibility, but we are no longer actively testing against that version and cannot guarantee that the Swift SDK will work.
